**Career:**  
After graduating with a Business degree in Supply Chain Management & Analytics, I spent a small stint as a data analyst for a transportation company before realizing I needed something more technically challenging for my career. A few friends who worked in tech recommended learning how to code with python.

I spent a few months using what little free time I had to learn as much as possible. Coming from a data analyst role which relied _heavily_ on excel for most of our work, learning python, sql, and R was the natural progression. Although this quickly shifted once I installed linux and discovered how powerful python can be outside of data. 

Months of dedication helped me land an entry-level developer role at a local consulting company. During my time here I worked for a number of different clients using a wide variety of technologies. Outside of work I focused my time on learning more about linux, docker, kubernetes, and eventually Go. Which helped influence the types of clients I was allocated to and helped define the types of roles in tech I'd be most interested in.

This eventually led to a full-time DevOps Engineer role at another local consulting company which I'm still in.
