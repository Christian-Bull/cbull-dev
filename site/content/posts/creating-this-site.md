title: "Creating this site"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been floating around the idea of creating a personal site ever since I got started in tech. The issue being I created an unrealistic goal of writing it from scratch with whatever web framework I was using at the time. I'd spend a few hours setting up the backend then stall out when it came time to build out the frontend. Even at the start, I had zero aspirations of doing web development for any duration of time. So honestly I have no idea why I got this thought in my head.

Fast forward to now, where I'm rather far removed from web development which allows me to disregard current trends. When researching a tool I had a general idea of what I wanted but had little idea what was out there. I quickly came across static site generators and that seemed to fit the bill.

A few requirements:
- simple design
- pages/blogs editable in markdown
- no javascript

A rather quick search led me to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), an open-source static site generator written in Go. With a simple content management model and a large library of themes to choose from, this seemed like the best choice.

Following their [quick start](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) I was up and running in a matter of minutes. Now I'll skip over the hours I spent testing out themes and say I ended up going with [etch](https://github.com/LukasJoswiak/etch). It fit all my requirements above and seemed to fit my use case.
